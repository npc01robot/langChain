The book follows the powerful Lu family in the city of Yuzhou, who have risen to prominence through strategic marriages and military alliances. They are constantly threatened by rival factions and maintain a strong army, including the renowned Black Iron Cavalry. The protagonist, Qin Yi, faces difficulties in his own family as they are not as influential as the Lu family. When a middle-aged merchant recognizes Qin Yi as a member of the prestigious Qin family, he eagerly tries to establish a connection. Despite being from a noble family, Qin Yi remains humble and agrees to help the merchant. As he travels, Qin Yi begins to realize the reputation and influence of his family, who have been known for their benevolence for generations. As he waits for the Lu family\\'s caravan to pass, he is approached by a group of people led by a bearded man he had met on the road the day before. Qin Yi sees an opportunity to potentially secure passage on a ship and decides to approach the bearded man, who turns out to be the manager of the Lu family\\'s shipping company. Qin Yi greets him politely and asks for passage, impressing the manager with his noble demeanor. As they discuss their plans, they are interrupted by another man, who initially appears hostile but is surprised by Qin Yi\\'s scholarly appearance and respectful manner.'"
